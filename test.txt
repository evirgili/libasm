This book is an introduction to assembly language programming for the x86-64 architecture of CPUs like the Intel Core processors and the AMD Athlon and Opteron processors.
While assembly language is no longer widely used in general purpose programming,
it is still used to produce maximum efficiency in core functions in scientific computing and in other applications where maximum efficiency is needed.
It is also used to per­ form some functions which cannot be handled in a high-level language.
The goal of this book is to teach general principles of assembly lan­ guage programming.
It targets people with some experience in program­ ming in a high level language (ideally C or C++), but with no prior exposure to assembly language.
